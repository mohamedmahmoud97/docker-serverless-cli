## Example

`example/apigw` is an example on how to use `amaysim/serverless`.

## Docker image

The Docker image has the following:

- Node 8.4 (Alpine): we leverage Babel to be compatible with AWS Lambda runtime
- [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com)
- [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
- zip: handy to zip your own serverless artefact
- [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli): required by some Serverless plug-ins to work
